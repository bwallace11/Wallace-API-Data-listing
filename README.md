3. **Modern JavaScript (ES6+)** - Apply modern JavaScript features including arrow functions, template literals, array methods (`forEach`), and promise chaining

4. **Modern Build Tools (Vite)** - Understand how to use Vite for fast development, hot module replacement, and building optimized production bundles
